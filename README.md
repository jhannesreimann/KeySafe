## General
KeySafe is a password safe/password manager written in C#. It is exclusively free for all Windows devices. The special feature is that KeySafe is only available offline. This means that no data/passwords are stored online. This guarantees a high level of security. This is my first major project, so please bear with me. 
Nevertheless KeySafe provides a not too overloaded number of features. The most special feature is that you can log in with a usb-stick, so no password is necessary.
